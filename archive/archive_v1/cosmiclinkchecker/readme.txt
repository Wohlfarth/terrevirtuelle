Installation Instructions
-------------------------

All files from the zip file should be uploaded into your cgi-bin, or any
folder which has been chmod 755.

Note: ALL FILES SHOULD BE UPLOADED IN ASCII.

The table below shows what chmod each file should be given
	File	     	  Chmod
¦ index.php   	     ¦	   755     ¦
¦ config.txt   	     ¦	   755     ¦
¦ main.css           ¦	   755     ¦


There is no configuration for this script! :o)

Trouble shooting
----------------

If you have any problems running this script then please check that you
have followed the installation to the word. If problems persist then please 
get in touch at steve@cosmicphp.com with the subject "TROUBLE" (all in caps).


BUG report
----------

If you find any bugs, glitches or problems then please contact me at
steve@cosmicphp.com with the subject "BUG" (all in caps).


Getting rid of that annoying link
---------------------------------

On some of the scripts you may find a small link back to the site generated at the
bottom of the page. Removing this will infringe my copyright so its best you 
leave it alone. If you do want to loose the link then it costs $5 per script. 
You will then receive an amended script without the linkback. Contact us at
sales@cosmicphp.com.


Using this script
-----------------

Having edited config.php so that the correct variables are set (example variables are
provided), simply load up index.php in your browser.
