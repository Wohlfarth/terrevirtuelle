                        a design that reflects your activity and your values. There 
                        are many graphic elements inside a website : logo, general interface, meaningful pictures,
                        icons, navigation layout, color harmony, content layout. </DIV>

                        Do you need somebody who regularly updates your information ? Would you like 
                        to improve accessibility for blind people ? Do you wish to 
                        publish any brochures to download or forms to fill-in by the 
                        public ? </DIV>

                        any technical knowledge about web publishing but you would 
                        like to manage independently your web contents. The solution 
                        is maybe an "opensource" portal such as <A target=_blank 
        href="http://www.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=116">Mambo</A> or <A target=_blank 
        href="http://www.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Navigation&amp;file=index">Postnuke</A>. 
                        Perhaps you will need a special tool setup with the
                        <a href="../../fckeditor/edit.php?action=browse">trio "php/MySQL/FCKeditor"</a> ?
                   </DIV>

        Please do 
        not hesitate to contact me by <A

        forward to meet and to discuss about your web project. </DIV>
