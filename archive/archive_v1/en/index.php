<h3 style="color: #000">What means webdesign ?</h3>
Webdesign is the design of webpages, websites and web applications. Webdesign requires various skills
in the field of graphic design, programming, databases and multi-media.
<br /><br>
The first aim of a website is to provide answers to the needs of information the readers can have.
Another objective of webdesign is to provide a positive image of the website owner.


<br><br>
Currently, a website does not only need to be perfect from the graphic or from the technical point of view.
You still need to find it in the virtual labyrinth. A good search engine ranking seems thus 
most important. What are the keywords used by people searching for a specific information?
Once we know the answer to this question, the website can be optimized according to the most adequate
terminology.<br><br>
A website project cares therefore about many more aspects than just about webdesign in the strict sense.
