    <h3 style="color: #000">Why Apple ?</h3>
	
      The main reason : I don't waist my time with virus related matters since there aren't any of them.<br>
      <br>
      Also because Mac is real plug and play, certainly with OSX 10.4 version which lets you connect anything like printers, scanners, cameras, external harddisks,
       wireless networks - and unlike some PC systems, it works immediately
       <br><br>
      Otherwise, stability of the system, simplicity to install software and the legendary design havec convinced me to become definitely an Apple fan.
